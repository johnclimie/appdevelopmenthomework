NAME: Exploring Relationships in Body Dimensions
TYPE: Observational
SIZE: 507 Observations, 25 Variables

DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:

This dataset contains 21 body dimension measurements as well as age, 
weight, height, and gender on 507 individuals. The 247 men and 260 
women were primarily individuals in their twenties and thirties, with a 
scattering of older men and women, all exercising several hours a week.

SOURCE:

Measurements were initially taken by the first two authors - Grete 
Heinz and Louis J. Peterson - at San Jose State University and at the 
U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Later, 
measurements were taken at dozens of California health and fitness 
clubs by technicians under the supervision of one of these authors.

VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:

Columns     Variable

            Skeletal Measurements:

   1 -  4  0 Biacromial diameter (see Fig. 2) 
   6 -  9  1 Biiliac diameter, or "pelvic breadth" (see Fig. 2)
  11 - 14  2 Bitrochanteric diameter (see Fig. 2)
  16 - 19  3 Chest depth between spine and sternum at nipple level, 
            mid-expiration
  21 - 24  4 Chest diameter at nipple level, mid-expiration
  26 - 29  5 Elbow diameter, sum of two elbows
  31 - 34  6 Wrist diameter, sum of two wrists
  36 - 39  7 Knee diameter, sum of two knees
  41 - 44  8 Ankle diameter, sum of two ankles

            Girth Measurements:

  46 - 50  9 Shoulder girth over deltoid muscles
  52 - 56  10 Chest girth, nipple line in males and just above breast 
            tissue in females, mid-expiration
  58 - 62  11 Waist girth, narrowest part of torso below the rib cage, 
            average of contracted and relaxed position
  64 - 68  12 Navel (or "Abdominal") girth at umbilicus and iliac crest, 
            iliac crest as a landmark
  70 - 74  13 Hip girth at level of bitrochanteric diameter
  76 - 79  14 Thigh girth below gluteal fold, average of right and left 
            girths
  81 - 84  15 Bicep girth, flexed, average of right and left girths
  86 - 89  16 Forearm girth, extended, palm up, average of right and 
            left girths
  91 - 94  17 Knee girth over patella, slightly flexed position, average 
            of right and left girths
  96 - 99  18 Calf maximum girth, average of right and left girths
 101 -104  19 Ankle minimum girth, average of right and left girths
 106 -109  20 Wrist minimum girth, average of right and left girths

            Other Measurements:

 111-114   21 Age (years)
 116-120   22 Weight (kg)
 122-126   23 Height (cm)
 128       24 Gender (1 - male, 0 - female)

The first 21 variables are all measured in centimeters (cm).

Values are separated by blanks. There are no missing values.

STORY BEHIND THE DATA:

The first two authors investigated the correspondence between frame 
size, girths, and weight of physically active young men and women, most 
of whom were within normal weight range. One goal of this investigation 
was to develop predictive techniques to assess the lean/fat body 
composition of individuals. 

PEDAGOGICAL NOTES:

These data can be used to provide statistics students practice in the art 
of data analysis. Such analyses range from simple descriptive displays 
to more complicated multivariate analyses such as multiple regression 
and discriminant analysis.
